As we are aware information or data is increasing at an amazing rate. In fact some industry expects that collected information sizes will probably double in size every two to three years. Basically data which is no longer needed by the application to address business functionality should be purged or archived. If data is required for record retention requirements, then it should be archived from the DBMS to an application controlled format. Keeping unneeded data online or in warehouses have costs associated with them which can directly affect our membership. Transactions can take longer to process, and use more CPU which also increases the cost of each transaction. DBMS utilities like backups can run longer, takes more storage and use more CPU (Increase product cost) Responsibilities		 Analysis of Business Requirements.

Develop the interfaces using flow service, create utility services, webservice Descriptors  . Create Unit test plan and Integration test plan documents with sample inputs provided from client Provide support during the test phase. Provide Post Production support after the completion of the project for 3 weeks a) Project Description GE Energy Infrastructure has created an umbrella project, the vision for which includes each GEI P&L to have EDI210 outbound integration with OTM. This includes the development of two integrations (source and target integrations).As a part of source integration, a webMethods provides the WSDL file to receive Glog XML file from OTM.Received Glog XML is converted into webMethods internal document type and mapped to canonical, and published to broker.WebMethods target integration subscribes the published canonical from webMethods broker and generates EDI210 files as per standard EDI210 schema. The generated EDI210 files are sent to Trax system through trading networks via AS2 protocol. Trax system will send the 997 ack back to webMethods with the status of EDI210 files. WebMethods validate the received 997 files and send the 997’s with rejected status, to OTM.OTM cross checks the rejected EDI210 files and resends the valid data. b) Contribution Gather requirements, analyze the existing canonicals. Develop the interfaces using flow service, create utility services, webService Descriptors.. Create Unit test plan and Integration test plan documents with sample inputs provided from client. Prepare all project related documents. Provide testing support in different environments. a) Project Description  GE Aviation Supply Chain business is consolidating its Legacy Purchasing applications in to a single Oracle eBusiness suite to manage and author the purchase orders. This requires building webMethods integrations to exchange PO, Supplier, Item data between central Oracle eBusiness suite and 22 Legacy applications/ERPs. For pilot implementation, Grand Rapids Legacy system is chosen. The scope of the project is to build integrations from PAC Oracle 12i instance to Grand Rapids Legacy system and vice-versa. There are total 21 Legacy systems need to be integrated with PAC instance. b) Contribution Create the project plan, gathering the requirements. Develop the interfaces using flow service, create utility services, webservice Descriptors    and also implemented HTTP post. Create Unit test plan and Integration test plan documents with sample inputs provided from client Provide support during the test phase. Provide Post Production support after the completion of the project for 3 weeks a) Project Description  This Integration is built to transport data from JULIET ERP to GEXPRO.It is implemented ONLY for OU_PG_WIND and OU_PG_CAN operating units. This connection will communicate purchase orders between the two systems.    Built EDI outbound integration to send EDI850 (Purchase Order) data to the partner and EDI inbound integration to receive EDI997 (Acknowledgement) from the partner.  b) Contribution Create the technical design of EDI850 and EDI997 basing on the requirements gathered (this interface was split into publish and subscribing integrations).

Title: Senior Analytical Hadoop / Spark Developer ECOMP is critical in achieving AT&T’s D2 imperatives to increase the value of our network to customers by rapidly on-boarding new services (created by AT&T or 3rd parties), enabling the creation of a new ecosystem of cloud consumer and enterprise services, reducing Capital and Operational Expenditures, and providing Operations efficiencies. It delivers enhanced customer experience by allowing them in near real time to reconfigure their network, services, and capacity. While ECOMP does not directly support legacy physical elements, it works with traditional OSS’s to provide a seamless customer experience across both virtual and physical elements. ECOMP enables network agility, elasticity, and improves Time-to-Market/Revenue/Scale via the AT&T Service Design and Creation (ASDC) visual modeling and design. The service design and creation capabilities and policy recipes eliminate many of the manual and long running processes performed via traditional OSS’s (e.g., break-fix largely moves to plan and build function). The ECOMP platform provides external applications (OSS/BSS, customer apps, and 3rd party integration) with a secured, RESTful API access control to ECOMP services.
